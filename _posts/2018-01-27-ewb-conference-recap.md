## A New Post

JustDesign members presented at the October 2017 EWB-USA National Conference in Milwaukee, WI - members which were former and current Engineers WIthout Borders-USA chapter/project leaders. 

The presenters shared lessons learned from their EWB-USA project experiences, engaged the audience in a participative process to consider key questions of how to incorporate meaningful social justice into their projects, noting the reality that it exists when involved in a development project.

This presentation and interactive audience discussion focused on the importance of the often under-valued social/soft-skills required in capacity building projects. The participants were challenged to look internally at their own EWB projects and organizational structures to analyze how development is prioritized. As a method of evaluation, the JustDesign team dove deeply into understanding  the role of power in community-led projects through an anti-oppressive and meaningful social justice lens. Additionally, focus was also placed on addressing elements of volunteer-saviorship mentality and how that permeates through all layers of organizations. By asking uncomfortable questions such as “who really has the power to make a decision, the community or yourself?” the team aimed to bring resiliency and self-determination to the forefront of what should guide a project.


1. Who are you serving and why? What do you prioritize and why? Who are your allies within your work? What do you consider success?

2. Who has the power to make a decision in your project/chapter? How would you re-distribute the power given what you’ve learned today? How might you, and your Chapter, begin to address that evolution?

3. If you could write key elements of harm reduction for all design professionals, what would it be?

4. What is your specific role/desired role in being a contributor to that world?
