## Open Access / Open Source Strategy
The open-source model is a model that encourages open collaboration. A main principle of open-source development is peer production, with documentation freely available to the public. Open source promotes universal access via an open-source or free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. 

Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.

The open-source approach helps to expand knowledge and provide access to free knowledge at a time when many forces are trying to enclose knowledge. The pressure on knowledge is similar to the pressure on social centers that are trying to resist enclosure.
